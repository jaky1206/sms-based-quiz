## About

This project was the initial version of an SMS-based quiz campaign, where users interacted with the system by sending specific commands via SMS, such as "START QUIZ" to begin and "STOP QUIZ" to end the quiz. To answer questions, users would send "QUIZ A" or "QUIZ B" to a designated shortcode.
